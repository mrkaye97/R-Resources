# R-Resources

An R (Tidyverse) bootcamp that I created for the students of my Spring 2019 ECON329 (Econometrics) TA section. 

Goals: 

- A basic introduction to the Tidyverse and LaTeX, specifically aimed at showcasing how powerful these tools can be.
- Introducing new Tidyverse users to the syntax and logic of the Tidyverse, including the grammars of dplyr and ggplot2 and the importance of the pipe operator
